Description

Similar to Space Invaders, your ship is on the bottom on the screen and above it there is a fleet of aliens. The objective is to fire bullets to destroy the aliens. You'll gain points by destroying aliens and once the whole fleet is destroyed, the fleet will be regenerated in a new level. Every time you pass to a new level aliens move faster. If an alien hits your ship or the bottom of the screen you will lose one life.

How to play ?

Move left and right using the left and right arrows.
Shoot bullets hitting the space bar.
Quit at any time by pressing "q".

I followed guidance from the book "Python Crash Course" (Eric Matthes, No Starch Press).
